    ## FYI :
    According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death for most races in the United States (African Americans, Native Americans, and Caucasians). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other indicators include diabetes status, obesity (high BMI), lack of physical activity, or excessive alcohol consumption. Identifying and preventing the factors with the greatest impact on heart disease is crucial in healthcare.
